go-git
======

Pure-Go implementation of Git as a library.

This is a fork of [gogits/git](https://github.com/gogits/git) (which was originally a fork of [speedata/gogit](https://github.com/speedata/gogit)). Unfortunately, *gogits/git* is [no longer maintained and is not accepting PRs](https://github.com/gogits/git/issues/13#issuecomment-152784720), so this is a continuation of that work.
